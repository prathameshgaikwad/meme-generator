The Meme Generator App is a fun and simple web application built using Vite and React. With this app, users can create hilarious memes by adding their own custom text to popular memes. The app uses the Imgflip API to fetch the top 100 memes, ordered by how many times they were captioned in the last 30 days. Users can enter both top and bottom text, and with a click of a button, generate a customized meme that they can share with friends and on social media.
